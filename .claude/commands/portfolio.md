### 5. Executive Summary Guidelines

The executive summary is the top section and should be scannable in under 2 minutes. It uses concise bullets — not paragraphs.

**Key Highlights should:**
- Lead with the most impactful progress or wins
- Reference specific milestones, decisions, or deliverables
- Be written for someone who has context but not details

**Risks & Concerns should:**
- Surface only items with real business impact
- Include enough context to understand the threat
- Note mitigation status where relevant

**Decisions should:**
- Focus on decisions with strategic or financial impact
- Explain why the decision matters, not just what was decided

**Items Needing Attention should:**
- Only include items that truly need executive awareness
- Include a recommendation where appropriate
- Note urgency and deadlines

**Tone:**
- Professional but not formal
- Confident but honest about challenges
- Forward-looking and actionable

### 6. Program Detail Highlight Logic

**Programs Needing Attention** should include programs that:
- Have yellow or red health
- Have overdue milestones
- Have open high-impact risks without recent updates
- Haven't been updated in 14+ days
- Have blocked dependencies

**Action Items Due This Week:**
- Filter to items with due dates within the next 7 days
- Sort by due date

**Decisions This Week:**
- Filter decision log to entries from the last 7 days

### 7. Follow-up Support

After presenting the portfolio review, be ready to:
- Drill into any specific program (`/brief [program]`)
- Show the board view (`/board`)
- Help create action items for attention items
- Log decisions for pending items
- Expand on any section of the executive summary

## Notes

- The executive summary is the primary deliverable — it should stand on its own for CEO-level consumption
- The program detail section provides the supporting data behind the summary
- Focus on items requiring leadership attention
- Avoid burying bad news but don't dramatize either
- If everything is green, say so confidently
- The goal is: executive summary for the quick read, program detail for the deep dive
