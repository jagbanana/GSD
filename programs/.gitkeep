# Programs Directory

This directory contains one markdown file per program.

Files are created by:
- `/setup` during initial configuration
- `/newprogram` when adding new programs

File naming: `[program-slug].md` (lowercase, hyphens, no spaces)

See `templates/program-template.md` for the expected format.
