# Decision Log

All major decisions across the portfolio, logged for future reference.

<!--
Decisions are added via:
- /decision [program] - standalone decision logging
- /debrief [program] - decisions made during meetings

Each entry includes:
- Date and summary (as heading)
- Program
- Full decision text
- Who made it
- Stakeholders consulted
- Rationale (the "why")
- Expected impact
- Optional revisit date
-->

## How to Use This Log

1. **Add decisions** using `/decision [program]` or during `/debrief`
2. **Reference decisions** when context is needed for related work
3. **Revisit decisions** on their scheduled dates to confirm they're still valid
4. **Search this file** when you need to recall why something was decided
